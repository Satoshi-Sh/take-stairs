  Take Stairs
</p>

This application keeps track of user's stair exercises. Users just need to put how many stairs they climb up and down. It shows the stats by bar and line plots, visualized data with Recharts.  API was created with express, interaction with MongoDB to get stored data. Passport.js was used to authorize the user.
